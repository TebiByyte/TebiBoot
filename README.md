# Welcome to TebiBoot

```
This is a supposed to be a simple bootloader aimed at beginners supporting both
legacy and UEFI booting for x86_64 architectures. 
```

# Goals:
```
Create a simple to understand implementation of legacy and uefi booting, while being 
straight-forward to understand for people looking to create their own bootloaders, or 
just getting something working quickly.
```

# How to use:
```
Simply clone the repository, use the make command, and you can then run with your emulator
of choice using the resulting ISO file. 
```
